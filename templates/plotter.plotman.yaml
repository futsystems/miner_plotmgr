        #

        # host, and that the module is configured to match the local path.

        #        # plotman will skip forward up to 'index' drives (if they exist).
        #        # This can be useful to reduce io contention on a drive on the
        #        # archive host if you have multiple plotters (simultaneous io
        #        # can still happen at the time a drive fills up.)  E.g., if you
        #        # have four plotters, you could set this to 0, 1, 2, and 3, on
        #        # the 4 machines, or 0, 1, 0, 1.
